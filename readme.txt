# Animated Weather Card

This project creates an interactive animated weather card that displays weather information for different times of the day, including dynamic backgrounds, sun/moon movement, and weather-specific animations.

## Features

  * **Hourly Weather Display:** Shows temperature, time, and weather conditions for each hour of the day.
  * **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Transitions between day and night backgrounds based on the time.
  * **Sun and Moon Animation:** The sun and moon rise and set realistically with the changing hours.
  * **Weather Visualizations:** Features animated effects for rain, snow, clouds, and thunderstorms.
  * **Interactive Scroll:** Users can scroll through the hours to see future weather conditions.
  * **Clickable Hours:** Clicking on a specific hour updates the main display with its weather data.

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
  * **CSS3:** Styling and animations.
  * **JavaScript (jQuery):** Handles dynamic content, user interactions, and weather logic.
  * **[particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/):** Used for creating the animated cloud and snow effects.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd animated-weather-card
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

    No special server setup is required as this is a front-end only project.

## How to Use

  * **Scroll through the hours:** Use your mouse wheel or scrollbar on the hourly forecast section at the bottom to navigate through the day's weather.
  * **Click on an hour:** Click on any of the hourly forecast blocks to immediately jump to that hour's weather display.
  * The main display at the top will update to show the temperature, weather type, and whether the forecast is for "Today" or "Tomorrow".
  * The background, sun/moon, and weather animations will change dynamically with the selected hour.

## Project Structure

  * `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the weather card.
  * `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling and visual effects.
  * `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for data handling, DOM manipulation, animations, and event listeners.

## Customization

  * **Weather Data:** You can modify the `hoursData` array in `app.js` to include different weather conditions, temperatures, or add more days.
  * **Styling:** Adjust the `style.css` file to change colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual aspects of the weather card.
  * **Animations:** Modify the CSS animations or the JavaScript logic for `particles.js` to customize the weather effects.

## Acknowledgements

  * **Google Fonts:** "Plus Jakarta Sans" for typography.
  * **Google Material Symbols:** Weather icons.
  * **[particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/):** For particle animations (clouds and snow).
  * **jQuery:** For DOM manipulation and event handling.
